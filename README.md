# CSpectra

The repository contains a C API for the [Spectra](https://github.com/yixuan/spectra) eigensolver. Spectra depends on [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen). Make sure that both libraries are installed using CMake.

Pre-compiled binaries for windows users can be found [here](http://wo80.bplaced.net/packages/#package:spectra).

## Why?

The project was created to maintain Spectra builds matching the [CSparse.Interop](https://github.com/wo80/csparse-interop) bindings for C#.
