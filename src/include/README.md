This folder should contain the Eigen and Spectra header files. To check that everything is in the right place, make sure the following files exit:

* src/include/Eigen/Core
* src/include/Spectra/GenEigsBase.h

If you have Eigen installed in a differnt folder, make sure to adjust the include paths in the Visual Studio project file.
